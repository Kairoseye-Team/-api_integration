# AI-Powered API Monitoring and Anomaly Detection System

This system provides real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics for distributed API environments.

## Features

- Real-time API monitoring across distributed environments
- Anomaly detection for response times and error rates
- Predictive analytics for potential system failures
- Cross-environment correlation analysis
- Scalable log aggregation and analysis
- Interactive dashboards for visualization

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configurations
```

3. Start the monitoring service:
```bash
python -m src.main
```
